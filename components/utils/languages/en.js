While collecting energy, your summoner is also at risk of exposure. Exposed summoners enter into battle, where the energy of the winner increases, and the energy of the loser returns to 0, which is a dead/looted state. Summoners in the dead state can execute the triggerCaptureMechanism function. If execution is successful your summoner's energy increases and the once-dead summoner will be reactivated and can participate in the energy plundering war again.",
